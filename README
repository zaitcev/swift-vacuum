A repository of small scriptlets for OpenStack Swift

swift-vacuum
swift-vacuum.py
   Run "vacuum;" .db files
   This was the first scriptlet, so it gave the repository its name.

rsyncd-matrix.py
   Compute the bandwidth of rsyncd
   This is used to make matrix of node-to-node and find bad network
   links and/or nodes at a glance. It should compute the matrix itself
   but does not.

swift-put-count.py
   Sum up lengths of PUT requests
   This helps to see what's streaming into the cluster. Can be adapted
   to compute aggregate bandwidth and the breakdown by size.
